  <!-- Trip Description -->
  <h2>A Recent Trip</h2>
  <p>A few years ago, my family rented an RV, along with two other families, and drove up the coast of California, Oregon and Washington.
    We stopped in a few towns in each state, staying at the same campsites and cooking dinner altogether and doing activities like
    riding dune buggies and river rafting!

    Poke is my favorite! I love poke bowls with all the fixings but I could eat just raw fish with some sauce all day every day.
